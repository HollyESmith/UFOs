# UFO Sightings

## Analysis Overview & Purpose
In an earlier project, an interactive webpage was created to allow users to parse data around UFO sightings. The purpose of the current Challenge was to create additional filters that would allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results

The final webpage:

###How to perform a search
-- there is a description of how to perform a search with images

There are 5 filter criteria; use more than one parameter to narrow the search. For example, the user can filter by state, in this example, California (ca):

Or, the user could filter by 2 (or more) parameters, in this example, state (ca) and shape (triangle)

## Summary
-- address one drawback
-- address 2 additional recommendations for further development
In summary, this was an excellent first step in creating a robust interactive webpage for users to explore UFO data. One drawback of the website are the infinite options for "duration." I feel that it would be more useful if the data were grouped in timeframes, for example, < 60 seconds, 1 to 10 minutes, 11 to 20 minutes, more than 20 minutes.

One drawback of this website was the inability to alphabetize the data by column title, which could be useful for a quick data analysis. 


Recommendations for future revisions:
Allow the user to sort the by column title, which could be useful for a quick data analysis. 

I feel that the "Filter Search" feature is in need of improvement - I recommend adding a brief "How to Use" paragraph for guidance, including:
- use only lowercase
- clear the filter by clicking "UFO Sightings" in the upper left corner of the page

In addition, if a placeholder is required in the HTML script, I recommend making the font opaque - I found it confusing to search by one criteria and continue to see the placeholder information.
