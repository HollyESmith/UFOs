# UFO Sightings

## Analysis Overview & Purpose
In an earlier project, an interactive webpage was created to allow users to parse data around UFO sightings. The purpose of the current Challenge was to create additional filters that would allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results

### The final webpage:

### How to perform a search

There are 5 filter criteria; more than one filter at a time may be used to narrow a search. For instance, the user can filter by state (ca):

![filter by ca](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97558998/166557806-b91f2f64-e321-469b-86be-31091a304aa0.png)

Or, the user could filter by 2 (or more) parameters; in this example, state (ca) and shape (triangle):

## Summary
In summary, this was an excellent first attempt to create a robust interactive webpage for users to explore UFO data. One drawback of the website is the infinite possibilities for "duration." I feel that it would be more useful if the data were grouped in timeframes, for example:
* < 60 seconds 
* 1 to 10 minutes 
* 11 to 20 minutes 
* \> 20 minutes

### Recommendations for future revisions:

1. Allow the user to sort by column title, which could be useful for a quick data analysis. 

2. Add a brief "How to Use" paragraph for the Filter Seach, and include guidance such as:
   + use only lowercase
   + clear the filter by clicking "UFO Sightings" in the upper left corner of the page

3. In addition, if a placeholder is required in the HTML script, I recommend making the font opaque - I found it confusing to search by one criteria and continue to see the placeholder information (see screenshots above).
